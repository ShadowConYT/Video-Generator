In a dilapidated mansion on the outskirts of town, I stumbled upon a chilling puzzle. Etched into the dusty floor was a cryptic inscription: "Three keys unlock the hidden door." Curiosity gnawed at me, and I vowed to unravel its secrets.

With each step, the silence was broken by the creaking of floorboards and the howling of the wind. I searched meticulously, finding the first key hidden in a cobwebbed attic. The second lay concealed beneath a loose stone in the cellar. But the third key eluded me, as if the mansion itself guarded its whereabouts.

Desperation clawed at me as the shadows grew longer. Suddenly, a flicker of movement caught my eye. Nestled in the rafters, the gleaming metal gleamed. With trembling hands, I reached for the third key, knowing that the hidden door awaited me.
