In a quaint attic, dust swirled as I stumbled upon a peculiar puzzle. Its cryptic symbols teased my mind, beckoning me closer.

With trembling hands, I deciphered a chilling message: "He who ascends the creaky stairs shall meet their doom." Intrigued and terrified, I hesitated. But curiosity gnawed at me, compelling me to tread upward.

As I cautiously made my way, each step creaked ominously, sending shivers down my spine. At the top, I found a weathered box. Inside, a single key lay nestled.

But as I reached for it, a cold hand shot out from the shadows, its bony fingers seizing mine. A spectral laughter filled the air, echoing through the empty corridors. The attic grew darker, enveloping me in suffocating fear.
