A dusty puzzle lies on a table, its intricate carvings promising secrets untold. But as the traveler begins to unravel its twisted pieces, a chilling realization dawns.

Fossilized blood stains the wooden surface, and the faint echo of a scream hangs in the air. Suddenly, the cabin's door slams shut, plunging them into darkness.

The traveler's heart pounds as unseen forces toy with them, moving the puzzle pieces around like malevolent chess pieces. Fear consumes them as they realize: the twisted puzzle holds more than just a mystery... it holds their very soul.
