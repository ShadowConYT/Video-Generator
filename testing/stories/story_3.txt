In a realm of shadows, a chilling tale unfolds. One moonlit night, as the wind howled like a banshee, a group of friends ventured into a dilapidated mansion. Rumors of strange occurrences had haunted the neighborhood for years, but curiosity got the better of them.

As they cautiously stepped inside, a musty odor filled the air and creaky floorboards groaned beneath their feet. The house was shrouded in darkness, save for the flickering glow of a solitary candle in the hall. The friends stumbled through the maze-like corridors, their hearts pounding with anticipation and trepidation.

Suddenly, a blood-curdling scream echoed through the darkness. They froze in their tracks, their bodies trembling in fear. The candle flickered wildly, casting grotesque shadows that danced menacingly on the walls. Adrenaline surged through their veins as they searched frantically for the source of the scream.

As they approached a shadowy doorway, they heard a faint scratching sound. Slowly, they pushed the door open, revealing a dimly lit room. In the center of the room, on a dusty old table, lay a mysterious puzzle box. It was intricately carved with symbols that seemed to glow with an eerie luminescence.

Compelled by an irresistible force, one of the friends reached out and opened the box. Instantly, the room was flooded with an ethereal light, and a disembodied voice whispered a chilling riddle:

"In darkness I dwell, where fear resides,
A guardian of secrets that time hides.
To unlock my secrets, three keys you must find,
Hidden within the shadows you'll leave behind."

The friends exchanged uneasy glances, their curiosity now tinged with a growing sense of dread. They had stumbled upon a sinister game, and the stakes were far higher than they could have ever imagined. As the candle flickered its last, plunging the mansion into darkness, the friends knew they had no choice but to embark on a perilous quest to solve the puzzle and escape the haunted mansion before it consumed them whole.
