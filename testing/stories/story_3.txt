There was once a boy named David who loved to go fishing in the ocean. One day, he went out in his boat and cast his line into the water. He waited patiently for a while, and then he felt a tug on his line. He pulled it in and was surprised to see that he had caught a huge fish. The fish was so big that it almost filled the entire boat. David was so happy that he couldn't stop smiling. He had never caught a fish that big before.

David decided to take the fish home to show his family and friends. He rowed his boat back to shore and carried the fish to his house. He put it in the bathtub and filled it with water. The fish was so big that it filled the entire bathtub. David's family and friends were amazed when they saw the fish. They had never seen anything like it before.

David's dad called the local news station, and soon reporters and photographers were at their house. They took pictures of David and the fish and interviewed him about how he caught it. David was so excited to be on TV. He told the reporters that he had been fishing in the ocean for years, but he had never caught anything like this before.

The next day, David's story was in the newspaper. People from all over the town came to see the fish. David was so proud to show it off. He knew that he would never forget the day he caught the biggest fish in the world.
