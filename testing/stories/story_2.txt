There was once a boy fishing in the ocean and he caught a fish. The fish was very big, he was so happy. He took it home and cooked it for dinner. But when he took a bite, he realized the fish was rotten. He was so grossed out, he threw the fish away.

But later that night, he started to feel sick. His stomach hurt and he started to vomit. He thought he was just getting food poisoning, but it was much worse.

The next morning, he woke up and he couldn't move. He was paralyzed. He tried to scream for help, but no one could hear him. He was all alone.

He lay there for hours, helpless and scared. He watched as the sun went down and the darkness crept in. He knew he was going to die.

Suddenly, he heard a sound. It was a faint scratching at the door. He tried to turn his head, but he couldn't move. The scratching got louder and louder.

Then, the door slowly creaked open. A figure stepped into the room. It was tall and thin, with long, sharp claws. The figure walked towards him, its eyes glowing red in the darkness.

The figure raised its claws and plunged them into his chest. He felt a sharp pain as the figure ripped his heart out. He screamed, but no one could hear him.

He died alone and in pain. His body was never found.
