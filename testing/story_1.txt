There once was an old house on the edge of town that had been abandoned for years. The locals said it was haunted, and no one dared to go near it. One day, a group of teenagers decided to prove the locals wrong. They snuck into the house and started exploring.

They found the house to be dark and dusty, with cobwebs in every corner. They could hear the wind whistling through the broken windows, and it sounded like someone was crying. The teenagers started to get scared, but they were too afraid to run away.

They continued to explore the house, and they soon came to a room that had been sealed off with a brick wall. They tried to break through the wall, but it was too strong. They were about to give up when they heard a noise coming from the other side.

They listened closely, and they could hear a child laughing. The teenagers looked at each other in terror, and they knew they had to get out of there. They ran out of the house and didn't stop running until they were safely back in town.

The teenagers never went back to the house, and they never spoke of what they had heard. But they knew that the house was haunted, and they were never going to forget the sound of that child laughing.
