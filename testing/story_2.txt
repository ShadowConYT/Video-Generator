There was once a girl named Mary who went on a camping trip with her friends. They were hiking in the woods when they came across a strange cabin. The cabin was old and abandoned, and the windows were boarded up. Mary's friends were scared and didn't want to go inside, but Mary was curious. She opened the door and stepped inside.

The cabin was dark and dusty. Mary could hear the sound of her own heart beating in her chest. She took a deep breath and stepped further into the cabin.

As she walked through the cabin, Mary noticed that there were strange symbols carved into the walls. She didn't know what they meant, but they made her feel uneasy.

Mary continued to explore the cabin until she came to a bedroom. In the middle of the room was a bed, and on the bed was a young girl. The girl was asleep, and she was very beautiful.

Mary approached the bed and gently shook the girl's shoulder. "Wake up," she said. "It's time to go."

The girl opened her eyes and looked at Mary. Her eyes were black and empty, and they seemed to pierce right through Mary.

"Who are you?" the girl asked.

"I'm Mary," Mary said. "I'm here to help you."

The girl laughed. "Help me?" she said. "You can't help me. No one can."

"Why not?" Mary asked.

"Because I'm cursed," the girl said. "I'm cursed to live in this cabin forever. No one can come in here and save me."

"That's not true," Mary said. "I can save you."

The girl shook her head. "You can't save me," she said. "No one can."

Mary took a step closer to the bed. "I can," she said. "I believe I can."

The girl looked at Mary with hope in her eyes. "Do you really believe that?" she asked.

"Yes," Mary said. "I do."

Mary reached out and took the girl's hand. "Come on," she said. "Let's get out of here."

The girl smiled and nodded her head. She took Mary's hand and stood up. Together, they walked out of the bedroom and out of the cabin.

As they walked away from the cabin, Mary could hear the sound of the girl's laughter. She was free at last.
