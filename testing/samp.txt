Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a dragon named Fafnir. He was a fearsome creature, with scales as hard as diamonds and claws as sharp as razors. His breath was fire, and his eyes were like molten gold. Fafnir lived in a cave on top of a mountain, and he guarded a treasure that was said to be worth more than all the gold in the world. One day, a brave knight named Siegfried came to the mountain. He had heard of Fafnir's treasure, and he was determined to take it for himself. Siegfried climbed to the top of the mountain and found the cave where Fafnir lived. He drew his sword and charged into the cave, ready to face the dragon.
Fafnir was surprised to see Siegfried. He had never been challenged by a human before. He roared and charged at Siegfried, breathing fire from his mouth. Siegfried dodged the fire and swung his sword. He struck Fafnir's scales, but the sword bounced off harmlessly. Siegfried knew that he had to find a way to kill Fafnir. He looked around the cave and saw a large rock. He picked up the rock and threw it at Fafnir. The rock hit Fafnir's head and knocked him unconscious. Siegfried quickly ran over to Fafnir and cut off his head. He then took the treasure and left the cave. Siegfried returned to his kingdom and was hailed as a hero. He used the treasure to help his people and to build a new kingdom.
